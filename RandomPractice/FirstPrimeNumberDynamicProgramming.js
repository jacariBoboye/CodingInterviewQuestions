/*
Given a number n, print all primes smaller than or equal to n. 
It is also given that n is a small number.

What is a prime number?: 
1. Must be an integer larger than 1
2. A number than can only be divided by itself or by 1. 
3. Opposite of a prime number is a composite number.
What is dynamic programming?: 
Top down approach(Recursive):
- Maintaining values of computed operations to save time 
Bottom down approach(Iteratively):
- 
What is Sieve of Eratosthene algortithm:
Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 to n: (2, 3, 4, â€¦, n).
Initially, let p equal 2, the first prime number.
Starting from p, count up in increments of p and mark each of these numbers greater than p itself in the list. 
These numbers will be 2p, 3p, 4p, etc.; note that some of them may have already been marked.
Find the first number greater than p in the list that is not marked. If there was no such number, stop. 
Otherwise, let p now equal this number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.

According to Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm the initial condition for inner loop should start from " i = p*p " and not from " i = p*2 ". As for the above implementation extra operations are done. For example for p = 7, the index 14,21,28 are made false. If it was " i = p*p " then these operations need not be executed. The reason being the prime numbers less than 7 have already marked these indexes.
