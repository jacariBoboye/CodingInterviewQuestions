/*
Coin game: Alice and Bob are playing a game using a bunch of coins. The players pick several coins out 
of the bunch in turn. Each time a player is allowed to pick 1, 2 or 4 coins, and the player that gets the
last coin is the winner. Assume that both players are very smart and he/she will try his/her best to work out
a strategy to win the game. For example, if there are 2
1
coins and Alice is the first player to pick, she will definitely pick 2 coins and win. If there are 3 coins 
and Alice is still the first player to pick, no matter she picks 1 or 2 coins, Bob will get the last coin and win 
the game. Given the number of coins and the order of players (which means the first and the second players to pick 
the coins), you are required to write a program to calculate the winner of the game, and calculate how many different 
strategies there are for he/she to win the game. You should use recursion to solve the problem, and the parameters are 
read from the command line. You can assume that there are no more than 30 coins.
